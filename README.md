# Hotel Booking and Cancellation Analysis (interactive DashBoard Creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to understand patterns of reservations and cancellations, and to develop predictive models that can forecast the likelihood of a booking being canceled.
## DataSet Used
- <a href ="https://github.com/masuqueali91/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Hotel-Booking-and-Cancelation-Data-Set-/blob/main/Copy%20of%20hotel%20Analysis.xlsx"> Hotel Booking Data </a>

## Question(KPIs)
- What is the cancellation rate of bookings?
- What is the average daily rate (ADR) for city hotels vs. resort hotels?
- Which market segment (online, agent, direct) has the highest cancellation rate?
- What is the average lead time for canceled vs. non-canceled bookings?
- How many special requests are typically made by guests who cancel vs. those who don’t?
- Which month/season shows the highest cancellations?
- What is the revenue loss due to cancellations?
- Which room type has the highest cancellation rate?
- Dashboard Interaction <a href = "https://github.com/masuqueali91/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Hotel-Booking-and-Cancelation-Data-Set-/blob/main/HotelBooking%20.png">View Dashboard</a>

## process 
- Collect Data – Use the hotel booking dataset (City & Resort hotels).
- Clean Data – Handle missing values, remove outliers, format dates.
- Explore Data (EDA) – Check cancellation rate, lead time, ADR, booking patterns.
- Feature Engineering – Create useful features (stay length, total guests, season).
- Build Model – Train ML models to predict cancellations.
- Evaluate Model – Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Insights – Find reasons for cancellations and give hotel recommendations.
